_although webrtc is a peer connections communications i will refer the streaming machine and the server as the host for my simplicity and the reciever peer as the client._ 

__how to find the users for the connections ?__<br>

STUN and TURN servers are used for bypassing the nat and finding the ip address for peer connections\
a STUN server isa public server on the internet when the clients to establish connections it first\
sends a binding request to the stun server the stun server and the server send the binding respone back to the client including\
this public ip address and port hen the other peer tries connections tho that public ip and port your router having recently\
sent data out from that specific port often has a hole or mapping open in its nat table this ( hole punching in the internet)
___

__why there is no need for stun and turn server in this project__\
my main motive is implementing this streaming for local networks and this is done through sharing data among same subnet\
hence we don't need ice server for stun and turn  for find the works this can be done by just getting ip address and data\
and there is no NAT for this networks

__how to gain the video capture or the screen__\
this is done through ffmpeg as solution for os screen capture this is send send to the stdout the server then reads this
___

__steps for webrtc__
1. start the screen recording using the ffmpeg on the host file
2. create the peerconnections 
3. add media tracks - pipe ffmpeg into a webrtc stream 
4. create a sdp offer ( this is for lan use only)
5. signaling via http ( get the offers using http)
6. ice candidate exchange this is for host only 
7. start the media stream

__SDP(session description protocol)__

this is generated by the browser for the client <br>
this contains the codec , ice credentials , fingerprint and stream informations <br>

__the client browser__<br>
the client browser creates the offer and set the local descriptions and sends it via http post<br>

__the host server__
this host server accepts the json for sdp and the type <br> 
then sets its remote description and creates the answer and return the json to the client 

__how does the client and the host transmit this ?__<br>
this is can be done using a specific end point in the http server the browser can generate the sdp itself and post it to the endpoint

---
__how to generate and gathaer the sdp for both the client and host server__<br> 
the browser generate the sdp and post req to the server at the /sdp endpoint here<br> 
then the server reads the json with content : application/json header request<br> 
this is now then used to set the configurations for host when the host is ready and configed<br> 
this is used to then run the connections
